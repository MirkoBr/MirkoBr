I am a bioinformatician and dedicated scientist interested in (post-) transcriptional RNA regulation and cancer biology. My passion is the visualization and integration of high-throughput data. Looking at results from as many angles and perspectives as possible is my ambition. My interest in package development led me to work on <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/help/search/index.html?q=BindingSiteFinder/">BindingSiteFinder 🚀 </a>  to make the definition of RBP binding sites more robust, reliable and reproducible.
